    * constrctor (function) - RMEGo.Form.AutoSaver(Form ID)
    * isDebug (function) - return a bool value whether is in debug mode now.
    * collect (function) - start to collect the form and save the input data.
    * events (function) - use custom functions instead of the default procedure functions.
    * run (function) - start running the autosaver.
    * die (function) - kill the running autosaver.
    * recover (function) - recover the saved data to the form.
    * dataset (array) - the element in it is a object with the structure of {name, type, value/indexes}, each obejct represent a user input.
    * procedure (object) - a key-value object that config the procedures would be used during the AutoSaver running.
    * DOM (HTMLElement) - the HTMLElement pointed to the form.
    * FieldElements (array) - this is a array of HTMLElement. each HTMLElement is pointed to a control in the form.
    * settings (object) - this is a key-value object that config the AutoSaver Instance and tell the AutoSaver how to work.

> 0.0.1.1    2017/04/14    Add event initial to AutoSaver procedure

> 0.0.1.2    2017/04/14    Add savingNoTimeout to handle change event
    It would save immediatelly when the control lost focus (as the control changed the attribute `value` and then triggered `change` event).
    Bug fix: 
        * When check the dataset[i].indexes, Error happens and says dataset[i] is not defined. (The reason is that the dataset[i] have been deleted, and the `dataset[i]` there is indeed `dataset[i+1]`)
        * When saving the data, it does not collect the form. Do not have any calling of the collect function there.

> 0.0.2.2    2017/04/17    Add Detect procedure and detect function to AutoSaver
